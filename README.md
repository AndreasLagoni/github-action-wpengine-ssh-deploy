## Setting up your SSH keys

1. [Generate a new SSH key pair](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) as a special deploy key. The simplest method is to generate a key pair with a blank passphrase, which creates an unencrypted private key. 

2. Store your public and private keys in the GitHub repository if your website as new 'Secrets' (under your repository settings), using the names `PRIVATE_KEY_NAME` and `PUBLIC_KEY_NAME` respectively with the name in your specfic files.  

2. Add these same SSH Keyes to youw WP Engine SSH Gateway configuration. https://wpengine.com/support/ssh-gateway/#addsshkey
